% Abstract
\begin{abstract}
\noindent
CYRUS is the official token of the PARS community, honoring the extraordinary legacy of Cyrus the Great (Kourosh-e Bozorg, c. 600--530 BCE), founder of the Achaemenid Empire and author of humanity's first declaration of human rights. This token serves as a unifying symbol for the global Persian diaspora---an estimated 8 million people spread across continents who share a 2,500-year heritage of civilization, culture, and the revolutionary principles first proclaimed in the Cyrus Cylinder.

Built for the PARS community and the broader Iranian diaspora, CYRUS creates a decentralized platform for cultural preservation, educational initiatives, and humanitarian action. Through DAO governance, token holders direct treasury funds toward Persian cultural centers, language programs, heritage preservation, and support for those facing oppression---continuing the liberating mission that Cyrus began in ancient Babylon.

This whitepaper details the historical significance of Cyrus the Great, the tokenomics designed for sustainable community growth, and the governance structures that empower the PARS community to build a lasting legacy worthy of its founder.
