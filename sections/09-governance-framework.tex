Empires fall when governance fails. The CYRUS DAO is designed to endure---not through force, but through legitimacy, transparency, and institutional excellence. This section details the governance framework that will make CYRUS a respected institution worthy of the Persian legacy.

\subsection{The CYRUS Constitution}

The DAO operates under a written constitution that establishes fundamental principles, rights, and constraints. The constitution is stored on-chain and can only be amended through supermajority governance.

\subsubsection{Constitutional Principles}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=persianblue!10!white,colframe=persianblue,width=\textwidth,arc=3mm,boxrule=2pt]

The CYRUS DAO exists to unite the Persian diaspora, preserve Persian culture and heritage, support humanitarian causes, and advance the cause of freedom for Iran and all peoples.

\vspace{0.2cm}

\textbf{Article II: Rights of Members}
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
    \item Every token holder has the right to vote on proposals proportional to their holdings

    \item No treasury disbursement may exceed 5\% of total treasury without supermajority approval
    \item No constitutional amendment may take effect in less than 30 days
    \item The multi-sig may not act without on-chain governance approval except in emergencies

    \item 14-day discussion period
    \item 67\% supermajority approval
    \item 20\% quorum of circulating supply
    \item 30-day timelock before implementation
    \item Ratification by multi-sig (ministerial, not discretionary)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Proposal Types and Thresholds}

\begin{table}[h]

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Proposal Types and Requirements}
\end{table}

\subsection{Board of Directors \& Leadership}

The CYRUS DAO operates under the guidance of a Board of Directors that provides strategic direction and institutional legitimacy while preserving decentralized governance principles.

\subsubsection{Founding Chair: Cyrus Pahlavi}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=persiangold!10!white,colframe=persianblue,width=\textwidth,arc=3mm,boxrule=2pt]
\centering
\textbf{\Large Cyrus Pahlavi}\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
\textit{Founding Chair of the CYRUS Board}
\end{tcolorbox}

Cyrus Pahlavi serves as the Founding Chair of the CYRUS Board, providing strategic leadership and representing the continuity of Persian civilization's highest values. His role embodies:

\subsection{Legal and Compliance Structure}

\subsubsection{Legal Wrapper}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{CYRUS Foundation}: Non-profit foundation (jurisdiction TBD---likely Switzerland, Cayman, or Marshall Islands)
    \item \textbf{Purpose}: Hold IP, enter contracts, employ staff, interface with traditional institutions
    \item \textbf{Governance}: Foundation board elected by DAO governance
    \item \textbf{Limitations}: Foundation cannot act contrary to DAO governance
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Regulatory Compliance}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Securities Law}: CYRUS is a governance token, not a security; no promise of profits
    \item \textbf{AML/KYC}: Grant recipients and large holders subject to verification
    \item \textbf{Sanctions}: No transactions with OFAC-sanctioned entities (exception: humanitarian aid to Iranian civilians per OFAC exemptions)
    \item \textbf{Tax}: Foundation files appropriate tax returns; members responsible for own taxes
    \item \textbf{Legal Counsel}: Retained counsel in US, EU, and relevant jurisdictions
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Jurisdictional Considerations}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=persianred!10!white,colframe=persianred,width=\textwidth,arc=2mm,boxrule=1pt]
\textbf{Important Notice on Iran Sanctions:}

US and EU sanctions on Iran create legal complexity for Iranian diaspora projects. CYRUS takes the following position:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item We comply with all applicable sanctions laws
    \item We utilize humanitarian exemptions where available
    \item We do not transact with sanctioned individuals or entities
    \item We support humanitarian aid to Iranian civilians, which is generally permitted
    \item We advocate for smart sanctions that target the regime, not the people
    \item Members are responsible for their own jurisdictional compliance
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Consult legal counsel before participating if you have concerns about sanctions compliance.}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Dispute Resolution}

\subsubsection{Internal Disputes}

Disputes between members or regarding governance shall be resolved through:

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Discussion}: Good-faith dialogue in community forums
    \item \textbf{Mediation}: Volunteer mediators from community

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{External Disputes}

Disputes with external parties shall be resolved through:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item Foundation legal counsel negotiation
    \item Mediation through agreed neutral party
    \item Binding arbitration (ICC or similar)
    \item Litigation only as last resort
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Governance Health Metrics}

The DAO shall track and publish metrics indicating governance health:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{}lll@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Metric} & \textbf{Target} & \textbf{Concern Level} \\ \midrule
Voter Participation & >30\% & <10\% \\

Whistleblower Reports & Any & Unresolved >30 days \\
Audit Findings & 0 critical & Any unresolved \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Governance Health Dashboard Metrics}
\end{table}

\subsection{Continuous Improvement}

The governance framework itself is subject to continuous improvement:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]

    \item \textbf{Community Feedback}: Standing proposal category for governance improvements
    \item \textbf{Benchmarking}: Compare to best practices in other DAOs
    \item \textbf{Academic Input}: Engage governance researchers for periodic review
    \item \textbf{Failure Analysis}: Post-mortem on any governance failures
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=persiangold!10!white,colframe=persianblue,width=\textwidth,arc=3mm,boxrule=2pt]
\centering
\textbf{\Large Governance is Not Bureaucracy}

\vspace{0.3cm}

These structures exist not to slow us down, but to make us \textit{trustworthy}.

\vspace{0.2cm}

A liberation movement that cannot govern itself honestly\\
has no business offering governance to a nation.

\vspace{0.2cm}

\textbf{We will be the institution we wish Iran to become:\\
transparent, accountable, just, and free.}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Transition to Sovereign Iran}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=persianblue!10!white,colframe=persianblue,width=\textwidth,arc=3mm,boxrule=2pt]
\centering
\textbf{\Large The Ultimate Goal: Return to Iran}

\vspace{0.3cm}

CYRUS exists to serve the Persian people. When Iran is free,\\
governance should return to those it was always meant to serve.
\end{tcolorbox}

\vspace{0.3cm}

The CYRUS DAO is designed as a \textit{transitional institution}. Our ultimate purpose is not to govern the diaspora in perpetuity, but to support the liberation of Iran and then \textbf{transfer governance to the sovereign Iranian people}.

\subsubsection{Handover Principles}

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Democratic Legitimacy}: Governance may only be transferred to a legitimately elected, democratic Iranian government that respects human rights and rule of law
    \item \textbf{Constitutional Alignment}: The receiving government must demonstrate commitment to the principles of the Cyrus Cylinder---freedom of religion, freedom from oppression, respect for human dignity
    \item \textbf{Gradual Transition}: Transfer will occur in phases over 3-5 years, not as an abrupt handover
    \item \textbf{Community Approval}: Handover requires 75\% supermajority approval from token holders
    \item \textbf{Asset Protection}: Mechanisms ensure treasury assets serve Persian cultural and humanitarian purposes even after transfer
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Trigger Conditions}

The handover process may be initiated when:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item A democratic election is held in Iran with international observation
    \item The elected government formally requests partnership with CYRUS
    \item The government demonstrates 2+ years of respecting human rights, press freedom, and minority rights
    \item A mutual agreement is reached on transition terms
    \item Token holders approve initiation by 67\% majority
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Handover Structure}

\textbf{Phase 1: Recognition (Year 1)}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item Formal partnership agreement between CYRUS DAO and Iranian government
    \item Joint committee established with diaspora and government representatives
    \item Iranian representatives added to CYRUS Board (up to 3 seats)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Phase 2: Integration (Years 2-3)}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item Treasury begins funding projects jointly selected with Iranian government
    \item Iranian Ministry of Culture/Heritage gains advisory role
    \item Gradual transfer of cultural preservation programs to Iranian institutions
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Phase 3: Transition (Years 4-5)}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item Majority of Board transitions to Iranian government appointees
    \item Treasury management transfers to joint diaspora-government foundation
    \item CYRUS token may be adopted as official cultural token (if desired by both parties)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Phase 4: Completion}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item Full governance transferred to Iranian-majority institution
    \item Diaspora retains minority representation to ensure continuity
    \item Mission continues under sovereign Iranian leadership
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Safeguards}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Reversal Clause}: If the Iranian government reverts to authoritarian practices, token holders may vote (67\%) to pause or reverse the transition
    \item \textbf{Protected Endowment}: 20\% of treasury placed in permanent endowment that can never be seized---continues funding cultural preservation regardless of political changes
    \item \textbf{Diaspora Rights}: Diaspora token holders retain voting rights on cultural matters even after transition
    \item \textbf{International Oversight}: Transition monitored by recognized international bodies (UN, EU, etc.)
\end{itemize}
