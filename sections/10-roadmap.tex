The CYRUS token follows a deliberate three-phase roadmap aligned with Nowruz, the Persian New Year celebrated on the spring equinox. This symbolic alignment honors our heritage while creating a thoughtful, community-first launch.

\subsection{Phase 1: Genesis (January 2026 $\rightarrow$ Nowruz 2026)}

\textit{``I am Cyrus, king of Anshan...''}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=persiangold!10!white,colframe=persianblue,width=\textwidth,arc=2mm,boxrule=1pt]
\textbf{Bonding Curve Sale | No Transfers | Community Formation}
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item Token deployment on Base blockchain
    \item Bonding curve opens: \$0.01 starting price
    \item \textbf{Transfers locked} --- tokens can only be purchased, not transferred
    \item Website and whitepaper publication
    \item Initial community formation
    \item Social media presence established
    \item No speculation --- only believers accumulate
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Why lock transfers?} This prevents speculation and dumping during the critical formation period. Only those committed to the mission will participate --- not flippers seeking quick profits.

\subsection{Phase 2: Accumulation (Nowruz 2026 $\rightarrow$ Nowruz 2027)}

\textit{``I gathered all their peoples...''}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=persiangold!10!white,colframe=persianblue,width=\textwidth,arc=2mm,boxrule=1pt]
\textbf{Nowruz 2026 (March 21): Transfers Enable | DEX Launch | Trading Begins}
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Transfers unlocked} on Nowruz 2026 (March 21, 2026)
    \item Liquidity pool deployed to DEX (Uniswap/Aerodrome on Base)
    \item Secondary market trading begins
    \item DAO governance goes live
    \item Community governance proposals begin
    \item Partnerships with Persian cultural organizations
    \item Persian community events worldwide
    \item 10,000+ token holders target
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Phase 3: Awakening (Nowruz 2027+)}

\textit{``I restored them to their homelands...''}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=persiangold!10!white,colframe=persianblue,width=\textwidth,arc=2mm,boxrule=1pt]
\textbf{Nowruz 2027: Full DAO Treasury Activation | Major Initiatives Launch}
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item Full 50\% DAO treasury unlocks for governance
    \item Major grant programs launch
    \item Persian language school funding begins
    \item Cultural center partnerships established
    \item Heritage preservation initiatives
    \item Academic partnerships and scholarships
    \item Documentary and media productions
    \item International Persian heritage events
    \item 100,000+ community members target
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Vision: Nowruz to Nowruz}

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1.2]
    \node[draw, rounded corners, fill=persianblue!20, minimum width=2.5cm, minimum height=1cm] (genesis) at (0,0) {\textbf{Genesis}};
    \node[draw, rounded corners, fill=persiangold!30, minimum width=2.5cm, minimum height=1cm] (accum) at (4.5,0) {\textbf{Accumulation}};
    \node[draw, rounded corners, fill=persianred!20, minimum width=2.5cm, minimum height=1cm] (awaken) at (9,0) {\textbf{Awakening}};

    \draw[->, thick] (genesis) -- (accum) node[midway, above] {\small Nowruz '26};
    \draw[->, thick] (accum) -- (awaken) node[midway, above] {\small Nowruz '27};

    \node[below=0.3cm] at (genesis) {\small\textit{Buy Only}};
    \node[below=0.3cm] at (accum) {\small\textit{Trade \& Build}};
    \node[below=0.3cm] at (awaken) {\small\textit{Full DAO}};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

This deliberate, patient approach demonstrates our commitment to building something lasting --- not a pump-and-dump scheme, but a genuine movement to unite the Persian diaspora and honor Cyrus the Great's legacy.
