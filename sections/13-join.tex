\subsection{For the Persian Diaspora}

CYRUS is more than a token---it's a movement to unite and empower the global Persian community. Whether your family left Iran in 1979 or your ancestors were part of earlier migrations, whether you speak fluent Farsi or are learning your heritage language, whether you live in Tehrangeles or a small town with no other Persians---CYRUS welcomes you.
