# CYRUS Whitepaper

> *"I am Cyrus, king of the world... I gathered all their peoples and restored them to their homelands. I did not allow any to terrorize the land."*
>
> --- The Cyrus Cylinder, 539 BCE

The official whitepaper for the CYRUS token---honoring Cyrus the Great (Kourosh-e Bozorg), founder of the Achaemenid Empire and author of humanity's first declaration of human rights.

**Built for the PARS Community and the Global Persian Diaspora.**

## About Cyrus the Great

Cyrus II of Persia (c. 600--530 BCE), known as Cyrus the Great, was a Persian emperor who:

- Founded the Achaemenid Empire---the largest the ancient world had seen
- Created the Cyrus Cylinder---the first declaration of human rights
- Freed the Jewish people from Babylonian captivity
- Established religious tolerance throughout his empire
- Built Pasargadae, featuring the first Persian gardens ("paradise")
- Is the only non-Jewish figure called "Messiah" in the Hebrew Bible

The United Nations recognizes the Cyrus Cylinder as the world's first charter of human rights. A replica is displayed at UN headquarters in New York, and October 29 is celebrated as Cyrus the Great Day worldwide.

## For the PARS Community

CYRUS unites the global Persian diaspora---an estimated 8 million people from Tehran to Los Angeles, London to Sydney---in celebration of our shared 2,500-year heritage and the timeless principles of freedom, tolerance, and human dignity.
